# Linked List

This repository showcases a JavaScript implementation of a singly linked list along with a set of methods for efficient manipulation and interaction with the linked list. The `LinkedList` class and the accompanying `Node` class are central components of this implementation.

## Assignment 1: Linked List Operations

This section illustrates a variety of operations that can be performed on the linked list:

1. `prepend(value)`: Adds a new node with the given `value` at the beginning of the linked list.

2. `append(value)`: Appends a new node with the given `value` to the end of the linked list.

3. `size()`: Computes the number of nodes in the linked list.

4. `getHead()`: Retrieves the head node of the linked list.

5. `getTail()`: Obtains the tail node of the linked list.

6. `at(index)`: Fetches the node at the specified `index` in the linked list.

7. `pop(value)`: Removes the first occurrence of a node with the specified `value` from the linked list.

8. `contains(value)`: Verifies if the linked list contains a node with the specified `value`.

9. `find(value)`: Searches for the first occurrence of a node with the specified `value` and returns its index. Returns `null` if the value is not found.

10. `toString()`: Converts the linked list into a string representation for easy visualization.

11. `insertAt(value, index)`: Inserts a new node with the given `value` at the specified `index` in the linked list.

12. `removeAt(index)`: Deletes the node at the specified `index` from the linked list.

Feel free to utilize this linked list implementation as a foundational tool for various data structure and algorithm exercises or as a reference for working with linked lists in JavaScript.
